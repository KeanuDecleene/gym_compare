### Gym Finder

Project idea that involves finding the 10 closest gyms to a user inputted location and displaying them by price per week,
or by distance from the location given. Currently learning how to make a responsive GUI using PyQt6, and becoming familiar with scraping websites/API calls using Python.
Also want to become familiar with packaging an app into an executable file.

### Gym Finder

Project idea that involves finding the 10 closest gyms to a user inputted location and displaying them best to worst by price per week,
or by distance from the location given. Currently learning how to make a resposive GUI using PyQt6, and becoming familiar with scraping/API calls using Python.
Also want to become familiar with packaging an app into an executable.
